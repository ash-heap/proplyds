We intend to create a procedural planet consisting of level of detailed terrain
with lakes, rivers, trees, and other plants.  The purpose is to give the player
an environment to walk around in and explore.

The primary goals will be the terrain of the planet along its rivers, lakes,
buildings and foliage all lit by a day/night cycle.  Our stretch goals will be
animated animals, wind (moving leaves and water), weather (random
rain/clouds/thunderstorms), atmospheric music, and dynamic lighting
(flashlight/torch).  Our extreme stretch goals are shadows and grass.

These goals are
