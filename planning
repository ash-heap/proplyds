Question: How to pass global information to systems and their components?

Answer: Make Entities containing global information.

Implementation...

    Window should be a Component, and the WindowManager should filter SDL events
    so that they are only passed to the windows they pertain to.
    
    Some systems should be owned by specific entities, and their processing
    commands should gather information about those entities.
    
    This is a generalization of ECS frameworks that admits the possibility that
    systems should not be singletons, that they shouldn't be purely executive,
    and it allows the use of the model throughout the depth of the engine.
